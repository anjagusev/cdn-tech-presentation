<Notes>
  When I quit my last job in December and decided to take time off, I had a few
  goals.
  <br />
  <br />
  1. Attend more conferences
  <br />
  2. Find mentors.
  <br />
  3. Get out of my comfort zone. I had never attended a conference completely alone
  without knowing anyone there.
  <br />
  <br />
  <p>
    At my previous job, I lacked mentorship and wanted to learn from people
    smarter and more experienced then me.
  </p>
  <br />
  This seemed like the perfect conference for networking and learning from
  people smarter.
  <br />
  <br />
  It was only one day, and that meant it was affordable to me at $250.

1. The Journey From Functional Applications to Intelligent Software <br/>
   <span style={{ fontSize: "30px" }}>
     {" "}
     - by Ideshini Naidoo, Senior Vice President of Engineering, Wave
   </span>

<Notes>
  <p>
    1. This was the starting talk and she spoke very well about how Wave has
    adapted to leverage AI. Wave existed pre AI but needed to adapt to
    intelligent software to remain relevant. They did this using a combination
    of Katfla, KSQl, and Live Processing. She gave an example where a user would
    go to fill out a form and then wave would generate an invoice. In between
    the time the user submitted and the invoice was generated, they would use
    machine learning to adjust how the invoice was delivered to the user. The
    way they implemented it allowed the code base to run as usual but events
    from AI could be communicated to the codebase to adjust the results.

<Notes>
  <p>
    The only photo of the entire event. This talk resonated most with me. He
    discussed things that slow down the agile process.
  </p>
  <p>Partially done work when one feature is put on pause for another</p>
  <p>I cannot remember what overproduction referred to</p>
  <p>
    Relearning - coming back to old code -- suggested improvement was better
    documentation
  </p>
  <p>Handoffs - between teams / departments. He mentioned QA a lot.</p>
  <p>Delays - I cannot remember this </p>
  <p>Task Switching - main cause of #1 </p>
  <p>Defects - switching back to bugs similar to 6 and 1</p>

3. Scaling Security and Compliance Without Slowing Down <br/> <span style={{fontSize:"30px"}}> - Margaret Syms, Senior Security Engineering Manager, Shopify</span>

<Notes>
  <p>
    The main thing from this talk that I can remember is "Trust, but verify"
  </p>
  <p>Discussed how to build systems of trust but also fail safes. </p>
  <p>
    Shopify uses a lot of bots and tools to ensure that developers are being
    compliant.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you push code without the required reviews, a bot will message you on
    slack prompting you to fill out a form specifying why you pushed without the
    reviewers
  </p>
  <p>
    Another bot would get triggered when an offer was given to a potential hire
    without two references being contacted.
  </p>
  <p>
    Interesting audience question was what if a developer needs access to a
    particular system / database that is restricted from them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Response was that Shopify would allow it, but have monitoring in place to
    ensure no bad actors.
  </p>

4. Machine Learning for Robotics <br/><span style={{fontSize:"30px"}}> - Angela Schoellig, Assistant Professor in Robotics, University of Toronto</span>

<Notes>
  <p>
    This talk was outside of the scope of the conference but added to mix things
    up
  </p>
  <p>
    Demonstrated drone videos that they have been working on and self driving
  </p>
  <p>
    This talk was really cool. Interesting questions were is there any
    communication and shared standards between self-driving efforts between
    companies and universities and sharing of code base and learnings. Answer
    was: very little
  </p>

5. Scaling Engineering Talent <br/> <span style={{fontSize:"30px"}}> -Ania Halliop, Director of Engineering, Freshbooks</span>

<Notes>
  <p>
    Discussed an issue where the career ladder at freshbooks was not transparent
    or clear and was causing talent to leave. They felt they had no other
    position to advance to but management or team lead.{" "}
  </p>
  <p>
    They overhauled their career ladder to add more structure that will attract
    and retrain top talent. These criteria helped to make clear who deserved
    promotions, where to improve and were measured based on things such as level
    of impact.
